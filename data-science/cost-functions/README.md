# Cost Functions

Cost functions are algorithms that give our machine learning models a way to know how well or how poorly they're doing at predicting an expected output. During fitting/learning, the model uses the output from the cost function to determine how to update its parameters.

In layman terms, the cost function measures the distance between the expected output and the actual output. It's a function that will return a number that is small if the performance of the model is good.
