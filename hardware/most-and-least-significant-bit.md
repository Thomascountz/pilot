# Most and Least Significant Bit

In multi-bit binary, the **most significant bit**, \(MSB\) is the bit with he largest value and is most often the leftmost bit. The **least significant bit** \(LSB\), which is most often the rightmost bit, is the bit with the lowest value.

For example, in the binary number `10000000`, `1` is the most significant bit. A change in this bit represents a change of `128`. In the binary number `00000001`, `1` is the least significant bit. A change in this bit represents a change of `1`.
