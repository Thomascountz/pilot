What are your hopes for \(joining\) the FED team? What are your fears? What are your burning questions?

## Strengths & Weaknesses \(15 minutes\)

What are your strengths \(as a contributor/leader/manager\). What are your weaknesses? What do you enjoy about software/the work we do? What do you dislike?  


## Introspection \(5 minutes\)

Draw how you’re feeling about your workplace environment and how it enables or prevents you from doing your best work. \(You can share this drawing to help answer the next few questions\).

## Culture Retrospection \(30 minutes\)

### Good or bad, what did you come into this meeting hoping to talk about? What is your ask of the team?

“Improve” “Shoutout” \(e.g. “Working-from-home feels fraught with tension and the general agreement around it seems ill-defined. Can we define some rules around it?”

### What cultural aspect of our team are you most proud of? What do we already do that we should give voice to?

“Keep” \(e.g. “Forming a snack train to head upstairs is a nice way to have informal chats!”\)

## Shared Customs \(25 minutes\)

### Expectations 

What expectations of the team or others do individuals hold? \(e.g. “I expect the team to set aside time for timely PR reviews.”\)

### Agreements 

How do we want to work together day to day? \(e.g. “We work on Central Time from 9am to 5pm”\)

### Boundaries 

What personal boundaries do you want the rest of the team to know about and respect? \(e.g. “I turn off Slack notifications on the weekend”\)

## Closing Thoughts & Pro-spection \(10 minutes\)

How can we incorporate these shared customs into our day-to-day work? How do we better embody our culture and better have our defined culture reflect our team?
