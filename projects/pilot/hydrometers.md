# Hydrometers

## Hydrometers for Home Brewing

When brewing an alcoholic beverage, it is possible to measure the total amount of alcohol produced during fermentation. This is often noted as “ABV”, or alcohol by volume, on a beer or wine label. When fermenting beverages at home, home brewers rely on a thermometer and _hydrometer_ to determine the final amount of alcohol in their brew. **It works by measuring how dense a liquid is expressed in** _**gravity**_**, or density relative to plain water. This can be then be used to determine much** _**sugar**_ **is in a liquid both before and after fermentation, and therefore, the amount of alcohol produced by the sugar-eating yeast.**

The other use of a hydrometer is to track the fermentation process over time. A brewer uses periodic measurements to determine if a brew has stalled out or if it’s ready to be bottled, for example. The timing of the fermentation can be used to help make decisions that effect the final beverage and offer insights that allows a brewer to replicate a successful batch.

## Using a Hydrometer

The process of taking a hydrometer measurement at home usually involves removing a portion of the fermenting liquid from the fermentation vessel, placing it in a graduated cylinder, and dropping in an analog device to take a measurement by eye. The brewer then must discard the sample so as to prevent contamination with the ongoing brew. This process introduces a seam for human error while realistically generating only up to a dozen or so measurements throughout a fermentation’s lifecycle.

Hydrometers measure the _relative density_ of a liquid based on the principle of buoyancy. The lower the density of the liquid, the further part B will sink. A scale is placed on part A to show depth that the instrument has sunk. The heavier a liquid, the higher the hydrometer will float.

Different hydrometers are calibrated for different liquids and ranges, and different scales are use for different industries. In brewing, a hydrometer is used to measure the amount of sugar in a brew both before and after fermentation. Before fermentation, the sugar content can be determined by a hydrometer to calculate the _potential_ alcohol level of the final brew. After fermentation, another measurement is taken to determine the net loss of sugar, which can be used to calculate the amount of alcohol present in the final beverage. \(Any sugar lost during brewing has been consumed by yeast to produce a proportional amount of alcohol\).

## Hydrometer Scales

### Specific Gravity \(SG\)

The Specific Gravity scale is relative to the _weight_ of water. `1.000` is the SG of water at `4ºC`.

### Potential Alcohol

The Potential Alcohol scale is used specifically for alcoholic beverage brewing. The typical scale ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Using this scale before fermentation will tell a brewer how much sugar could potentially be consumed to create a certain percentage of alcohol in the final beverage. In order to determine a final alcohol percentage, a second reading is taken _after_ fermentation. Subtracting the first reading by the second will give the brewer a final alcohol percentage.

### Brix & Plato

The Brix Scale is based on the percentage of sugar in liquid by weight. Typical scales range from 0 to 30 and the number represents the percentage of sugar in the liquid _by weight_. For example, a reading of `15ºBx` in a `100g` sample means that there are `15g` of sugar in the liquid being measured. The Plato Scale is nearly interchangeable, but instead of being said to measure _sugar_, it’s said to measure _dissolved solids_, i.e. not everything factored into ºP is considered “fermentable.”

### Sugar

The Sugar Scale gives a reading of ounces of sugar per gallon. For example, a reading of `15` means that there are `15oz` per `1` gallon of liquid.

### Calculation

There are conversion charts and calculators to convert to different scales for different needs. Typical glass hydrometers are calibrated with liquids at a specific temperature \(old ones for brewing at `15C` and newer ones at `20C`\), so it’s important to also take the temperature of the liquid you’re measuring. The weight of a liquid can be calculated based on different temperatures, so it isn’t necessary to try to adjust the temperature before taking a reading.
