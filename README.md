# Introduction

I enjoy writing a blog at [https://thomascountz.com](https://thomascountz.com), but it's here that I write archival/contemporaneous notes that are otherwise "unfit to publish." It's a place to organize my project notes, ideas, and observations, while also documenting my research, resources, and explorations.

## Projects

Below is a list of projects in various stages.
