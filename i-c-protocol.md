# I²C Protocol

I2C \(or I²C\) is a communication protocol for integrated circuits, namely microprocessors. It's an alternative to SPI \(Serial Peripheral Interface\) and UART \(Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter\) protocols.

The core benefits of I2C is that is allows for many sub-compenents to communication to a main component with only 2 logic wires, VCC, and ground.
