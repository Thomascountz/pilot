# Agile Inception Deck

## Introduction

The inception deck is an expectation-setting tool that consists of ten questions.

Projects fail, not because everyone isn’t all aligned, but because it began before everyone was on board; the assumption of consensus is the ultimate project killer.

The only way to gain consensus is to ask thoughtful questions.

Getting stakeholders involved is vital.

**Ask: why we are here.** This is a quick reminder about why we are here, who our customers are, and why we decided to do this project in the first place.

**Create an elevator pitch.** If we had thirty seconds and two sentences to describe our project, what would we say?

**Design a product box.** If we were flipping through a magazine and we saw an advertisement for our product or service, what would it say, and, more importantly, would we buy it?

**Create a NOT list.** It’s pretty clear what we want to do on this project. Let’s be even clearer and show what we are not doing.

**Meet your neighbors.** Our project community is always bigger than we think. Why don’t we invite them over for coffee and introduce ourselves?

**Show the solution.** Let’s draw the high-level blueprints of the technical architecture to make sure we are all thinking of the same thing.

**Ask what keeps us up at night.** Some of the things that happen on projects are downright scary. But talking about them, and what we can do to avoid them, can make them less scary.

**Size it up.** Is this thing a three-, six-, or nine-month project?

**Be clear on what’s going to give.** Projects have levers like time, scope, budget, and quality. What’s most and least important for this project at this time?

**Show what it’s going to take.** How long is it going to take? How much will it cost? And what kind of team are we going to need to pull this off?

## Ask: Why Are We Here?

To really get inside a customer’s head, you have to go see it for yourself. Work with the people who will use your system day-in-and-day-out. Get engaged. Ask questions. Become the customer.

The Commander’s Intent is a concise statement that expresses the goal/purpose of the project.

The goal is exercise the individual’s, “why are we here,” and validate it with the customers.

## Create an Elevator Pitch

* For \[target customer\],
  * Explains who the product is for and who would benefit
* Who \[statement of need or opportunity\],
  * Expands the problem/need
* The \[name of product\],
  * Gives life to the product
* Is a \[product category\],
  * Explains what the service is or does
* That \[key-benefits, reason to buy\].
  * Explains why the customer would buy it
* Unlike \[competition alternative\],
  * Covers why we don’t already use what’s out there
* Our product \[key-difference\].
  * Explain how this product is different; justifies the expenditure

The elevator pitch brings clarity, forces the team to think about the customer, and gets to the point. What is the product and who is it for? What is compelling about the product and why would customers buy it? What are the priorities? What really matters?

## Design a Product Box

If we could buy our product off of the supermarket shelf, what would the product packaging look like? Would we buy it?

These questions help the team focus on what’s compelling to the customers and the underlying benefits of the product.

1. Brainstorm the product’s benefits
   1. Explaining a products features is boring, instead, explain how the product makes their lives easier
   2. Convert features into benefits
   3. What are all the reasons a customer would buy our product
   4. Pick the top three
2. Create a slogan
   1. Say as much as possible in as few words
   2. Timebox to 10 or 15 minutes
   3. No slogan is too cheesy
3. Design a box
   1. Image a customer walked into the local software store and saw your product
   2. Draw that box!
   3. Don’t overthink it! Get them to buy it!

## Create a NOT List

Saying what a product WILL NOT do is just as important as discovering what it will do. Defining the scope this early on helps set clear expectations for the customer.

Decide:

1. What is IN scope
2. What is OUT of scope
3. What is UNRESOLVED

This sets up boundaries, but can/should be revisited if the time comes. The goal is to move all of the things in the UNRESOLVED section into either the IN or OUT sections.

## Meet Your Neighbors

With “Meet the neighbors,” you want to map out who is in your project community, get them on your radar, and start building relationships before you need them. That way, when the time comes, you won’t be complete strangers, and they’ll be in a much better position to help you.

## Show the Solution

Visualizing the solution is about getting a read on what we’re going up against technically and making sure everyone is cool with how we are going to build this thing.

Get together with the technical team and talk about how you see the product being built. Draw diagrams, play games, and try to get a feel for how big the project is going to be. Draw enough pictures to show everyone how you are going to build the system, set expectations around the risky areas, and make sure everyone is on board with the technical solution.

## Ask: What Keeps Us Up at Night

This questions invites a healthy discussion about some of the risks and challenges you and the team foresee and what to do to prevent them. Talking about risk is a great way of letting people know what you need for the success of the project.

You may not get everything that you need, but it essential to state your case and set expectations around consequences of early sacrifices.

Michael Bloomberg explains his favorite technique for handling risk:

1. Write everything down that could possibly go wrong.
2. Think really hard about how to stop those things from happening.
3. Then tear it up.

* It highlights project challenges early.
  * The time to talk about risk is now—at the beginning. It’s too late once the bomb has gone off. If you have any issues or have seen any showstoppers, now is the time to air them.
* It gives you a chance to call the craziness.
  * If you heard some crazy talk over the course of doing the inception deck, this is your chance to call it out.
* It just feels good.
  * There is something good about sharing and discussing your fears with others. It gives the team a chance to bond, share war stories, and just learn from each others’ experiences.

Remember, you have a lot of leeway here at the beginning of the project, and this is your chance to lay it on the line. Use it.

Create a list of risks with your team, and then divide it into risks worth tackling and risks that are not.

## Size It Up

Sizing it up basically involves looking at your estimates and coming up with a rough plan for your stakeholders. You have to factor in user acceptance testing \(UAT\), training, and anything else you need to do before going live. But all you are really doing is giving them a best guess of how big you think this thing is and whether it can be done in a reasonable period of time.

You have a couple of options when it comes to presenting your plan. You can put a stake in the ground and say you are going to deliver by date. Or you can commit to delivering a core set of features and be more flexible on the date. 

## Be Clear on What’s Going to Give

### Time

Time is finite. We can neither create it nor store it. We must simply do our best with that which is given. That is why agile warriors favor time-boxing their delivery efforts. A warrior knows that continuously pushing out release dates and delaying the shipment of valuable software reduces the customer’s return on investment and runs the risk of never releasing anything at all—the worst possible fate for any software project. And so the agile warrior fixes time.

### Budget

Budget is the twin of time. It too is fixed, finite, and usually not forthcoming in abundance. One of the most difficult things for a customer to do is to go to the sponsor and ask for more money. It does happen on occasion—but the experience is never pleasant. To avoid this unpleasantness, the warrior treats budget the same way as time. Fixed.

### Quality

There are those who believe quality can be sacrificed in the interest of time. They are wrong. Any short-term gain in speed, resulting from a reduction in quality, is a false and temporary illusion. Reducing quality is like juggling flaming machetes on a cold winter’s day. Yes, we may warm our hands briefly for a few moments, but at some point we are going to cut ourselves and get badly burned. And so quality too is fixed and always held to the highest standard.

### Scope

With time, budget, and quality fixed, the agile warrior is left but with one force around which to bend on a project: scope. If there is too much to do, the warrior will do less. If reality disagrees with the plan, the warrior will change the plan instead of reality. This makes some of my students uncomfortable. Many come to my dojo having been taught that plans are fixed, immovable, rigid things, never to be changed or altered. Nothing could be further from the truth. A date may be fixed. But a plan is not. And so, out of the four forces arrayed against him, the agile warrior will fix time, budget, and quality, and flex the project around scope.

## Show What It’s Going To Take

Make sure the customer understands what they’re signing up for when they choose to join an agile project.

* Can they commit the time?
* Are they empowered to make the necessary decisions?
* Are they willing to direct and steer the development of this project?

You can’t have multiple stakeholders, all approaching the team with different ideas about where the team should be headed, what the priorities are, and what to work on next. Instead, you want to make it very clear up front who’s driving the bus. That doesn’t mean other stakeholders don’t have a say—far from it. We just want the customer to speak to the team in one voice.

You may never need to talk about money on your project. Your budget may have already been set, and you will simply be told how much you have to work with.

If you do need to create a rough budget for your project, however, here’s a quick and easy way to get some rough numbers: Simply multiply the number of team members over the duration of your project, at some blended rate, and voila—you have your budget. Almost without a doubt, the greatest cost to your project walks on two legs and sits at a computer.
