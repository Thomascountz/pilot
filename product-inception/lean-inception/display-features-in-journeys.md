# Display Features in Journeys

### Process

At this point, we have a list of annotated features that the product should have and a display of user journeys which indicate how personas will interact with the product.

1. Put the main journeys and the visible features side-by-side
2. For each step in a journey, record any features that it needs

When this is done, there are usually two kinds of missing links:

* Some journeys are missing features; for these, we create new feature cards and annotate their effort, business value, and uncertainty.
* Some feature are not mapped to journeys; do we really need these features if they don’t play a role in a persona’s journey?
