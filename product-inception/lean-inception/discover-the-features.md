# Discover the Features

A feature is the description of an interaction between a user and the product or some other action the product performs. The description of the feature should be as simple as possible.

Start by considering something the user is trying to do, and then consider a feature the product should perform to support the task.

### Process

Using the discoveries from the previous exercise:

1. Write the product goals as columns prioritized high to low, left to right.
2. Write the personas as rows prioritized from high to low, top to bottom
3. Everyone suggest features and places them on index cards and tacks them to the board using the personas and goals

Key Question: “What should the product do so that this persona can reach this goal?”

There won’t necessarily be a feature for each persona/goal combination. 

If we end up with features that don’t correspond to a persona and goal, it should be rethought since it would seem their value is not linked to a user.
