# Sequence the Features

> The purpose of a Minimum Viable Product is to create a product that we can use to validate a small set of assumptions about a product and its role in a business.

### Process

Now that we have a list of features mapped to user journeys, we can now define a Features Sequencer.

1. Create the Features Sequencer template
   1. Usually a flipchart with numbered lines; the line height should fit one feature card and the width should fit three.
2. Explain the sequencer rules
3. Remind everyone of the activity goal:
   1. To define the sequence that we will deliver the features of the product
   2. To learn from each iteration by building an MVP that we can test our business case against
4. Everyone places the feature cards on the sequencer, moving them around as needed until an agreement is reached
5. The result shows the features for each iteration of the MVP

#### Feature Sequencer Rules:

1. A line can contain a maximum of three cards
2. A line cannot contain more than one red feature card \(high uncertainty\)
3. Each line must have at least one green feature card \(low uncertainty\) 
4. The effort score of the features cannot add up to more than 5 E’s
5. The value score of the features must add up to at least 4 $’s

Rule 1 limits the number of features being worked on at the same time, preventing having partially done features choking the discovery process.

Rues 2, 3, and 4 prevent unbalanced work periods of either too much uncertainty or too much effort.

Rule 5 keeps a constant focus on delivering high business value.
