# Product Vision

The vision defines the essence of the business value of the product and must reflect a clear and convincing message to the users.

Based on “Vision of the Product” from Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore:

* For \[final client\],
* Whose \[problem that needs to be solved\],
* The \[name of product\],
* Is a \[product category\],
* That \[key-benefits, reason to buy\].
* Different from \[competition alternative\],
* Our product \[key-difference\].

### Process

1. Write the product vision template on the whiteboard
2. Divide the team into small groups and ask each team to fill in one blank slot \(if possible\)
3. Gather the results to form the final statement

Oftentimes the sentence will be incoherent. Work together to make it make sense.
