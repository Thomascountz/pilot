# Showcase

For those not present for the entire inception, or for those who are interested, now is a good time to get them up to speed via a showcase. Recap the plan, but donâ€™t open up the floor for input. Any feedback about the result of the iteration should be collected and used when validating the hypothesis, but comments about the process at this point can be counter-productive.
