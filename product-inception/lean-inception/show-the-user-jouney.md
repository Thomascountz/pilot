# Show the User Jouney

User Journeys describe the sequence of steps a user follows in order to reach a goal. As we build a journey, the team questions whether or not there are alternative options about a userâ€™s goals and the products capabilities.

### Process

1. Select a persona
2. Identify a goal for that persona
3. Write the persona and their goal on a post it and place it on the top-left side of the canvas
4. Decide a starting point and write it on a post-it and place it on the canvas
   1. How does the persona start their day?
   2. What triggers the desire for achieving their goal?
5. Describe each following step on a post-it and place it next on the canvas; continue until the persona reaches their goal.
